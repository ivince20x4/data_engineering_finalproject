__Life Expectancy and Socioeconomic status in American states__

__Executive summary:__
1. While life expectancy in the United States has been on an increasing trend (2008 - 2017), there is still a concern of growing disparities at state level  

2. Studies have also shown that life expectancy increases with the socioeconomic status. (Source: Journey of the American Medical Association (JAMA)

3. Identifying the magnitude of the disparities and its contributing factors can facilitate government agencies in addressing these concerns. 

__Problem statement:__ 
1. How does life expectancy get impacted by socioeconomic factors  (income, healthcare access, risk to diseases, insurance coverage)? 

2. Do demographics (e.g. gender, race, and age) at the state level contribute largely to the life expectancy disparities?

3. Understanding these relationships can help government agencies to better design their solutions to tackle life expectancy gaps in the United States.
